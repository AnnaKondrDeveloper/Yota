						<div class="questions_item_name"> How much does it cost to repair a washer?
							<div class="questions_item_descr">It will cost you an average of $200 to get your washer running again. While replacing a drain pipe costs around $120, the washer gear case replacement may cost over $300. Replacing the water level sensor, one of the most frequent washer repairs, will cost you about $150.

						<div class="questions_item_name">What causes some washer repairs to be expensive?
							<div class="questions_item_descr">
								The cost of washer repair depends on several factors, like the maintenance history, the number of parts replaced, the type of parts replaced, and so on. For example, replacing the washer gearcase is more expensive than replacing the water level sensor.

						<div class="questions_item_number">[04]</div>
						<div class="questions_item_name">Is it worth having a washing machine repaired?
							<div class="questions_item_descr">
								Yes and No. Some parts of the washer, such as the water level sensor, fail more often than others. They are also relatively cheap and easy to replace to get your washer running again. An excellent way to determine whether it is worth repairing your washer is to consider the repair cost and the age of the washer. <br>
If your washer is less than five years old and the repair cost is less than half its price, it may be economical to repair as it still has years of service in it. On the other hand, if your machine is more than ten years old, buying a new model with current technology and better energy efficiency makes more sense. Call our washing machine repair team to diagnose what you exactly need.

						<div class="questions_item_name">How long does a washer repair take?
							<div class="questions_item_descr">
								Typically, it takes our washer repair technicians a few hours to repair your washer. Replacing simple parts may only take an hour or so for well-maintained washers.
For washers without proper servicing for a long time, it may take up to a day to repair and replace worn-out parts. We advise that you perform regular maintenance and repairs on your washing machine to keep it in good working condition.
