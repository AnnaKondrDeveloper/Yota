				<h2 class="title"> <span>Common WINE COOLER</span> <br> Problems We Fix</h2>
				<div class="problems_info">Based on your wine cooler's technology, it uses either a compressor or a thermoelectric system to cool. Our wine cooler service team of trained and licensed technicians will diagnose and fix all your wine cooler problems. These are the most common wine fridge repair issues we fix.</div>

					<div>Condenser fan problem</div>

				</div>

				<div class="problems_text problems_text_1">
				<span>The condenser is the heat exchanger of the compressor-type wine cooler. A faulty condenser may lead to overheating of the wine chiller system. The heat eventually reaches the cooler cabinet and its content.</span>	
			<span>If the condenser fan is not running, first ensure that it is free to spin. Check for dust and debris buildup on the condenser fan blades. If that does not solve the problem, you may call wine fridge repair services.</span>
			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="problems_item">
				<div class="problems_subtitle">Broken evaporator</div>
				<div class="problems_text">
				<span>The evaporator works with the condenser to lower the temperature in the chiller. If the evaporator fails, the refrigerant will not pick any heat even if the compressor runs continuously.</span>	
			<span>The evaporator may fail due to dust build-up or a broken fan. Sometimes there is ice around the evaporator; wait for it to melt before plugging in the cooler. If this does not solve the problem, you need to call the wine cooler service in your area.</span>
			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="problems_item">
				<div class="problems_subtitle">Defective thermostat</div>
				<div class="problems_text">
				<span>Thermostat replacement is a complicated procedure that requires a wine cooler repair professional. Book a wine chiller repair service online to replace a defective thermostat.</span>
				<span>The thermostat allows you to set and control the inside temperature of the wine cooler. It also supplies power to the cooling system, and if defective, it causes irregular temperatures inside the cooler.</span>
			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="problems_item">
				<div class="problems_subtitle">Compressor problems</div>
				<div class="problems_text">
				<span>The compressor is an essential part of the wine cooling process, it circulates the refrigerant to enable heat dissipation. Sometimes, the compressor may not receive enough power or receives excess power, causing overheating. </span>	
			<span>A faulty capacitor, which starts the compressor, will cause the compressor not to come on. Wine cooler compressor repair or replacement is complicated, so you will need to contact a wine fridge repair service in your area.</span>
			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="problems_item">
				<div class="problems_subtitle">Improper room Temperature</div>
				<div class="problems_text">
				<span>Environmental temperatures affect the functionality of a thermoelectric cooler. The ideal temperature for effective cooling is 50 to 80 degrees, and if it is hotter, the thermoelectric cooler will not be effective.</span>	
			<span>Since this is not a technical issue, you can quickly solve the wine cooler repair issue by turning up the AC or moving the cooler into a room with a lower temperature.</span>
			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="problems_item">
				<div class="problems_subtitle">Defective fan</div>
				<div class="problems_text">
				<span>A thermoelectric wine cooler has a condenser fan to cool hot air to keep the inside cool. Accumulation of excess dirt and debris or broken fan blades may lower the fan's efficiency, leading to a warmer internal environment. Contact our wine refrigerator repair service to fix the broken fan.</span>	
			<span></span>
			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="problems_item">
				<div class="problems_subtitle">Poor ventilation</div>
				<div class="problems_text">
				<span>Because of how it operates, a thermoelectric cooler needs proper ventilation to maintain cool temps. Ensure adequate ventilation by placing your cooler away from the wall and other obstacles. Place your cooler away from heat-generating appliances such as microwaves and ovens. Lastly, avoid placing other items on the cooler.</span>

						<div class="questions_item_name">What causes some wine cooler repairs to be expensive?
							<div class="questions_item_descr">
								Some wine cooler spare parts are more expensive than others. The repair cost will vary according to the parts replaced and their availability. Previous repairs and maintenance also influence the price. A well-maintained cooler is easier to repair and costs less than one without routine maintenance.

						<div class="questions_item_name">Is it worth having a wine fridge repaired?
							<div class="questions_item_descr">
								Consider age and repair costs before deciding between replacement and wine fridge repairs. A wine cooler lasts ten to fifteen years. It is worth repairing for up to ten years, as the cooler still has years of service. But, the older it gets, the more expensive it becomes to maintain. Consider replacing after ten years to avoid frequent breakdowns and a poor ROI.
