				<span>If your freezer is set to a temperature that's too cold, it can be the thermostat is stuck at a lower setting than normal or the freezer has a defective defrost heater. It can also be that debris has gotten into your appliance through cracks/gaps in the seals around doors and windows. </span>	
			<span>This can cause ice buildup that prevents proper airflow throughout the unit. Call Big City freezer repair professionals if you can't solve the issue.</span>

				<div class="problems_subtitle">Freezer Being Too Warm</div>
				<div class="problems_text">
				<span>If your freezer is set to a temperature that's too warm, it can also cause food spoilage and other damage. Possible causes of freezer being too warm include: <br>
					- The thermostat is stuck at a higher setting than normal. <br>
					- The freezer door has been left open for too long, which allows warm air inside of it. <br>
					- The freezer isn't getting enough power from its outlet or electrical cord to run properly. <br>
					 </span>	
			<span>
				- The freezer has a faulty compressor that isn't cooling down as intended because of age wear and tear over time on any part inside the motor, which causes friction between moving parts like bearings or seals causing them not to function correctly anymore. <br> Call a freezer repair technician to inspect the thermostat and replace any worn-out or broken parts.</span>

				<div class="problems_subtitle">Freezer Being Too Noisy</div>
				<div class="problems_text">
				<span>If your freezer is making noises that aren't normal for it, there may be a problem with the compressor or fan blades. Possible causes of this include: <br>
					- The compressor has worn down over time due to age wear and tear on any part inside of it which causes friction between moving parts like bearings or seals causing them not to function correctly anymore; this will create a loud noise. <br>
					- The fan blades are dirty and need to be cleaned- this will also create a noisy sound. <br>
					 </span>	
			<span>- There is ice buildup on the evaporator coils which can also cause your freezer to make strange noises. <br> Most often, the worn-out evaporator or condenser fan blades need replacing. Loose refrigerator parts may also obstruct the fan blades, causing the noise.</span>

				<div class="problems_subtitle">Water Leaking From the Freezer</div>
				<div class="problems_text">
				<span>If water is leaking from your freezer, it's likely that there is a problem with the seals around the door. This can be caused by: <br>

					- The seals are worn and need to be replaced. <br>
					- The seals have been damaged and need to be repaired. <br>
					- There is ice buildup on the evaporator coils which can also cause water leakage.</span>

								There are a few reasons why some freezer repairs can end up being more expensive than others.

Another reason is that the freezer may need to be disassembled for the freezer repair technician to access and fix the problem, which can add to the cost.
