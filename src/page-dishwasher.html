				<h2 class="title"> <span>Common DISHWASHER </span> <br> Problems We Fix</h2>
				<div class="problems_info">Our technicians are well trained and licensed to repair all types of dishwasher problems. Some of the most common dishwasher problems we repair include:</div>

			<div class="problems_item">
				<div class="problems_subtitle problems_subtitle_1">
					<div>Dishwasher won't start</div>

				</div>

				<div class="problems_text problems_text_1">
				<span>The main dishwasher repair issue is if your dishwasher doesn't start. Then you require to inspect the power source and connection to establish that it is getting power. Check the circuit breaker and the power plug. You can also plug your dishwasher into a different outlet with power.</span>	
			<span>If the door does not close properly, your dishwasher will not start. Check if the door latch is stuck and clean food debris on the door gaskets. If this does not help, your dishwasher may have a faulty motor or burnt electrical parts. Call your dishwasher repair technician to repair the motor or replace damaged parts.</span>
			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="problems_item">
				<div class="problems_subtitle">Dishwasher Leakage</div>
				<div class="problems_text">
				<span>Another common dishwasher repair issue is leakage. Leakages are dangerous due to the potential for secondary accidents such as slips and the danger of electric shocks. Faulty dishwasher doors, worn-out gaskets, and the use of excess soap can all cause leaks. Clean the door gaskets or have them replaced and ensure that they lock correctly.</span>	
			<span>A faulty float switch can also cause dishwasher leakages. The float switch regulates the amount of water in the dishwasher. A defective switch puts too much water into the dishwasher, causing leakage. Clean any food particles accumulated on the switch to resolve the leakage, or call dishwasher service in your area.</span>
			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="problems_item">
				<div class="problems_subtitle">Dishes come out dirty</div>
				<div class="problems_text">
				<span>Next, the dishwasher repair issue is overloading and incorrect dish stacking that causes dirty dishes to come out of a wash cycle. Arrange your dirty dishes so the water from the spray arm can reach the bottom of cooking pots. Additionally, scrape off excess food debris from your dishes before loading.</span>
				<span>Dirty spray arms and clogged filters can also cause your utensils to come out dirty. Blocked drainage also means that your dishes are rinsed with dirty water. Check and refill your rinse aid compartment if your dishes have water spots. You need to contact dishwasher appliance repair experts if you can't solve the issue.</span>
			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="problems_item">
				<div class="problems_subtitle">Dishwasher makes loud noises</div>
				<div class="problems_text">
				<span>If your dishwasher makes loud and unusual noises, you may have faulty components or obstructed moving parts. Bend spray arms and over stacked dishes will produce noises as the dishwasher runs. </span>	
			<span>Worn-out seals and bearing rings also cause rattling noises and need replacement. Call a dishwasher repair technician to inspect the pump and replace any worn-out or broken parts.</span>
			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="problems_item">
				<div class="problems_subtitle">Dishwasher smells bad</div>
				<div class="problems_text">
				<span>Avoid leaving your dishes in the dishwasher for extended periods. Trapped food debris at the filters and screens will produce a foul smell after some time. Clean the filters and screens regularly and pre-rinse dishes before loading to reduce food particles in the dishwasher.</span>	
			<span>Melted plastic may also cause a chemical smell. Plastic dishes may fall, coming into contact with the heating element. Stack plastic dishes correctly to avoid such occurrences or contact YOTA appliance repair serve dishwasher repair experts to solve the problem.</span>

							<div class="questions_item_descr">
								It is worth repairing most dishwasher features, costing an average of $200. But, if the dishwasher repairs become too expensive, you can try other options, especially for older units.
